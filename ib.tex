\section{Installing Fedora 26}

When picking an operating system for use with Infiniband, you want to watch the kernel versions used by the operating system, and the kernel version required by OFED.

In general, newer versions of the kernel will work alright, so if you use OFED designed for kernel 4.8, it will probably work alright with kernel 4.10 installed.

In the case of Fedora, the kernel versions are \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)#Releases}{reported on Wikipedia}, so it's easy to see what versions of the kernel are shipped with each version of Fedora. You can also look at \href{http://downloads.openfabrics.org/OFED/}{the releases page for OFED} to see what releases use what kernels.
